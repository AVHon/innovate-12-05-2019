### [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io)

Today, everyone will write and run code in Code Sandbox.

1. Open [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io) in a new tab.
2. In the top-right corner, click "Create Sandbox".
3. Select "JS Vanilla", which should be top row, second from the right. (DO NOT select "JS Vanilla + TS".)

#### A Brief Tour of Code Sandbox

On the top is a menu bar. The most important button is in the "File" menu: "save". Don't forget to use it!

On the left is a list of files. We will spend most of our time editing `index.js`.

In the middle is the editor. We will write our games in here.

On the right is the output. It looks like a little web browser window. When our game is ready to run, click the circular arrow button.

On the bottom-right is the console. It is initially collapsed, but expands when you click on the name. We will write and run one-off lines of code here. Also, errors in your game will be shown here.

### [Instructors' Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/innovate-12-05-2019-n7rh8)

The instructors will periodically put new versions of working games into our [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/innovate-12-05-2019-n7rh8). When we change our code sandbox, you will not see the changes until you reload the tab.

### [Instructors' Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/Y4EgOADmb8Bia-xKC5zgtZuMMnEkN38NYKIzy6jf6Tg/)

Throughout the day, we will write and change lots of code that is not necessarily part of a working game. To keep transient demonstrations and incomplete modifications away from our code sandbox, we will write these things on [cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/Y4EgOADmb8Bia-xKC5zgtZuMMnEkN38NYKIzy6jf6Tg/). Cryptpad should not need to be reloaded; it update to keep up with our every keystroke.

### [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G3ZPOtCJCUtviQLXGuoSYPIO3LPDh7fyg1CpABSeyUg)

We have a terse [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G3ZPOtCJCUtviQLXGuoSYPIO3LPDh7fyg1CpABSeyUg) with basic javascript principles.

# Files in This Repository

When we are done with each game, the instructors will put a complete copy of the game's code into this Github repository as its own file. In the future, you can copy these files and paste them into an editor to work on them again.
